# tariff-schedule-automation
Automating the creation and testing of UK tariff schedules through the use of multi-script code, functions, loops and automated checks in R. The code was developed in order to run and create 40 tariff schedues in one go, to save an innumeral amount of time not having to do this in excel. 

### Context ###

Part of the UKs obligation as an independent member of the World Trade Orgnisaiton (WTO) the UK is required to submit data to the WTO on all Free Trade agreements which have been notified and signed. Following EU-exit the UK signed approximately 40 Free Trade Agreements. This results in 40 individual data submissions of trade and full tariff data (tariff-schedule). 

### Background ###

This was my first experience working extensively creating technical and complicated R scripts to handle the scale of the data being trasnformed and automated. I self-taught myself functions and loops in R before this project. I was able to apply these lessons into practice developing more complicated functions and code than I ever had before. Given the complexity and possiiblites of data errors to creep in I developed automatic tests within the script to test logic to determine if errors had occured. This was a first for me and something I continued to apply on all further coding projects. 

Overall this is a proejct I leanred alot from and accrelated my coding ability and confidence - and something I produced which helped the organisation meet it's business critical requirements.
